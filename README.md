# BPlist-and-NSKeyedUnarchiver

> Tool for deserializing binary plist files and NSKeyedUnarchiver-coded files.

## Origin and licensing

Based on the implementation in Apple's open-sourced [CFBinaryPList.c](https://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-550/CFBinaryPList.c), licensed under APSL v2.0.
As a result, this code is likely a derivative work of said code,
therefore this code and all changes to it will be made public,
along with a copy of the
APSL v2 in [OriginalCode.APSL.LICENSE](./OriginalCode.APSL.LICENSE).

**However**, as this code does not use any of the original C code, original
or modified, I feel mildly comfortable in licensing this project as MIT, as
long as the source-publishing criteria are met.
